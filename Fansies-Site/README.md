# ChangeLog
This changelog is about all the updates that were made as a response to the feedback from Part 1.

{23 September 2025}
-The timeline is added with a realistic and clear timeline with weekly milestones in development
-A Budget was added with more detailed breakdown of the estimated costs
-The content was improved by changing the placeholder 
- I fixed the navigation to make sure that the links are consistent and user friendly

The below information is based on Part 2.

-I have updated about.html with layout container, timeline, budget, and footer

-I have completed products.html with layout container, navigation, product listings, and footer

-I have applied visual styles and interactivity using CSS properties and pseudo-classes

-I have completed visual styling and responsive breakpoints 

-I have applied relative units for font sizing and layout responsiveness (Question 3.2)

-I have used the srcset and the sizes attributes in the <img> so it can serve different images based on the different screen sizes.

Here are all the Responsive Design Evidence

*This is platform viewed from a Desktop (Asus Vivobook)
!{Laptop View}(Laptop-View.png)
This shows full layout with multi-column structure


*This is the platform viewed from a Tablet (iPad Air)
!{Tablet View}(Tablet-View.png)
This layout stacks vertically, navigation adjusts


*This is the platform viewed from a cellphone (Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra)
!{Mobile View}(Cellphone-View.png)
This makes the font sizes shrink, layout remains readable

I have tested the website using browser developers tools so I can simulate the desktop view, the cellphone view and the tablet view. The screenshots of each layout are included in this page and in the image folder and they demonstrate the responsiveness. The design of the platform adjusts the layout, font sizes and image scaling to make sure that the user gets optimal user experience across all devices.
